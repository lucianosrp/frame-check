# frame-check
**A static checker for pandas DataFrames**

## Why frame-check?

Working with pandas DataFrames can be error-prone when it comes to column access. How many times have you written code like this, unsure if the column actually exists?

```python
# Will this work? ü§î
result = df["customer_id"]
filtered = df[df["status"] == "active"]
```

**The current reality:**
- ‚úÖ Code runs fine in development with your test data
- ‚ùå Crashes in production when a column is missing
- üò∞ Hours spent debugging runtime `KeyError` exceptions

## The Problem

When accessing DataFrame columns, you typically have to choose between:

1. **Manual verification** - Tediously trace through your code to verify every column reference
2. **Runtime checks** - Add defensive programming with `if 'column' in df.columns:` everywhere
3. **Source check** - Verify columns existence in your file or database schema
4. **Cross your fingers** - Hope the columns exist and deal with crashes later

```python
# Defensive programming gets verbose quickly
if 'customer_id' in df.columns and 'status' in df.columns:
    result = df[df["status"] == "active"]["customer_id"]
else:
    raise ValueError("Missing required columns")
```

## The Solution

**frame-check** brings static analysis to pandas DataFrames - just like `mypy` does for Python types. It tracks DataFrame schemas through your code and catches column access errors *before* your code runs.

### See it in action:

```python
import pandas as pd

# frame-check knows this DataFrame has columns: Name, Age, City, Salary
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Name": ["Alice", "Bob"],
    "Age": [25, 30],
    "City": ["NYC", "LA"],
    "Salary": [50000, 60000]
})

# ‚ùå This will be caught by frame-check
result = df["customer_id"]  # Column doesn't exist!
```

**Error output:**
```
example.py:12:10 - error: Column 'customer_id' does not exist
  |
12| result = df["customer_id"]
  |          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |
  | DataFrame 'df' was defined at line 4 with columns:
  |   ‚Ä¢ Name
  |   ‚Ä¢ Age
  |   ‚Ä¢ City
  |   ‚Ä¢ Salary
  |
```

## Key Benefits

- üöÄ **Catch errors early** - Find column access issues during development, not production
- üß† **Smart tracking** - Understands DataFrame transformations like `groupby()`, `assign()`, and column assignments
- üîß **Editor integration** - Real-time error highlighting in your favorite editor via LSP
- üìù **Clear diagnostics** - Helpful error messages that show exactly where DataFrames were defined
- ‚ö° **Zero runtime overhead** - Pure static analysis, no impact on your running code

**frame-check** - Because DataFrame bugs shouldn't be a surprise! üêº‚ú®
